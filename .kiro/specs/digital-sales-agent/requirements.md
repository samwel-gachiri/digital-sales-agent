# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Digital Sales Agent Webapp is an AI-powered sales automation system that uses the Coral Protocol Interface Agent as the primary conversational interface, with integrated research, email automation, and voice sales capabilities. The system will automate prospect discovery, research, cold email generation, and voice-based sales conversations through a streamlined architecture that eliminates complex agent-to-agent communication issues. The solution focuses on production-ready functionality with direct API integrations and built-in fallback mechanisms.
