# Agent Communication Fixes

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **Simulation vs Real Agent Communication**
**Problem:** The Sales Interface Agent was using `await asyncio.sleep()` to simulate agent processing instead of actual Coral Protocol agent coordination.

**Fix Applied:**
- Replaced simulation delays with proper agent queue communication
- Added timeout handling for agent responses
- Implemented fallback responses when agents don't respond within timeout

### 2. **Queue-Based Communication Pattern**
**Problem:** The agent communication was using asyncio queues but not properly coordinating with the Sales Agent.

**Fix Applied:**
- Enhanced queue message formatting with detailed instructions
- Added proper timeout handling (60 seconds) for agent responses
- Implemented fallback responses for timeout scenarios

### 3. **Agent Coordination Flow**
**Problem:** The endpoints weren't properly coordinating with the Sales Agent which should orchestrate other agents.

**Fix Applied:**
- **Prospect Discovery:** Now sends detailed criteria to Sales Agent for coordination with Firecrawl and OpenDeepResearch agents
- **Lead Qualification:** Sends BANT qualification requests to Sales Agent for VoiceInterface coordination
- **Contact Initiation:** Sends contact requests to Sales Agent for VoiceInterface or email coordination

### 4. **Error Handling and Timeouts**
**Problem:** 408 Request Timeout errors when agents don't respond.

**Fix Applied:**
- Added proper timeout handling with fallback responses
- Implemented graceful degradation when agents are busy
- Added detailed logging for debugging agent communication

## Fixed Endpoints

### `/sales/discover-prospects`
- ✅ Now coordinates with Sales Agent → Firecrawl Agent → OpenDeepResearch Agent → Pandas Agent
- ✅ Timeout handling with fallback prospect generation
- ✅ Structured response with agent attribution

### `/sales/qualify-lead`
- ✅ Now coordinates with Sales Agent → VoiceInterface Agent → Pandas Agent
- ✅ BANT scoring coordination
- ✅ Fallback BANT analysis on timeout

### `/sales/initiate-contact`
- ✅ Now coordinates with Sales Agent → VoiceInterface Agent (for voice) or Email system
- ✅ ElevenLabs TTS integration through VoiceInterface
- ✅ Fallback contact responses

### `/sales/analytics`
- ✅ Already had proper agent coordination
- ✅ Coordinates with Sales Agent → Pandas Agent

## Communication Flow

```
Frontend → Sales Interface Agent → Sales Agent → Specialized Agents
                ↓                      ↓              ↓
            Queue System         Coral Protocol   Agent Tools
                ↓                      ↓              ↓
            Timeout/Fallback ← Agent Response ← Task Execution
```

## Agent Coordination Pattern

1. **Request Received:** Frontend sends request to Sales Interface Agent
2. **Message Queuing:** Sales Interface Agent puts detailed instruction in agent_question_queue
3. **Sales Agent Processing:** Sales Agent picks up message and coordinates with specialized agents
4. **Agent Response:** Sales Agent puts response in agent_response_queue
5. **Response Handling:** Sales Interface Agent processes response or handles timeout
6. **Frontend Response:** Structured response sent back to frontend

## Timeout Handling

- **Default Timeout:** 60 seconds for most operations
- **Fallback Responses:** Provided when agents don't respond within timeout
- **Graceful Degradation:** System continues to function even when some agents are busy
- **Error Logging:** Detailed logs for debugging agent communication issues

## Testing

Created comprehensive agent communication test suite (`test_agent_communication.py`) that verifies:
- API health and connectivity
- Coral Server connectivity
- Individual endpoint functionality
- Complete agent coordination flow
- Timeout handling
- Error scenarios

## Next Steps

1. **Monitor Agent Performance:** Use the test suite to monitor agent response times
2. **Optimize Timeouts:** Adjust timeout values based on actual agent performance
3. **Add Retry Logic:** Implement retry mechanisms for failed agent communications
4. **Enhanced Logging:** Add more detailed logging for agent coordination debugging
5. **Performance Metrics:** Track agent coordination success rates and response times
